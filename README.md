# My Beautiful Garden
This is university project I made for my fellow teammate.
All this project does actualy is storing the data about plants and gives access when it is needed.
It is available to store your own plants and after relaunch of the application data is saved.
All written in python 3.9+ version.
Database used is SQLite.
